# Employee-Tracker

## Description

Created a command-line application to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

* Created schemas for 3 tables: department, emmployee role and employee.  Within those tables, foreign keys were utilized to hold references to department IDs, employee ID, and employee role IDs.

* The app allows users to:
- View employees
- View Roles
- Add Employees
- Add Department
- Add Role
- Update Employee Role
- Remove Department
- Remove Roles
- Remove Employees
